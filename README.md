#homework1-Refactor

*First Homework Assignment

What I did
-I tried my best to clean up the HTML and CSS files
-Added semantic tags
-Made a better title 

General Notes about the assignment:
- Felt like this homework was pretty hard for me to get everything right. Very tedious. I often get confused between the different tags and which ones to use. I could not get the CSS file to be correct. I'm not very sure what I need to fix. I feel like with more time I could do a lot better though.
